# 🧿 Darkelf Cocoa Browser 4.0.10
### Ephemeral, Privacy-First macOS Browser (PyObjC + WebKit)

> A hardened, memory-only browser designed for **zero persistence**, **tracker resistance**, and **real-time threat detection** — installable via `pip`, launching a full native GUI.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Darkelf Cocoa Browser is a macOS-native browser built using **PyObjC + WebKit**, focused on:

- 🔒 Ephemeral browsing (RAM-only)
- 🧠 On-device AI threat detection (Darkelf MiniAI Sentinel)
- 🚫 Aggressive tracker & telemetry blocking
